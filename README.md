# osu-packet-2

osu-packet was orignally created by Itsyuka but Some bugs exists and Itsyuka isn't merging it So I've created another repo: osu-packet-2.

The osu! protocol library for nosue!lazer.

This package allows you to read/write the network packets of the game osu! It has both the client and bancho's packets,
more or less fully detailed and functional.

This does automagically parse, but has absolutely no logic to it, just provides data.

You can find the oddly documented functions in the /docs/ folder or at the documentation page
